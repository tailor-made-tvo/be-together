                <h3>Security</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/CSP/Introducing_Content_Security_Policy">Content Security Policy (CSP)</a>
                        HTTP headers are sent to the web browser from this site. CSP acts as a whitelist of resources that the
                        browser is allowed to access. If the browser tries to access a resource, not allowed by your CSP policy it is blocked. Configure your
                        CSP policy globally in FilterConfig.cs or on your individual MVC controllers and actions if they have special access requirements.
                        See FilterConfig.cs for more information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Modernizr does not currently support
                        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/CSP/Introducing_Content_Security_Policy">Content Security Policy (CSP)</a>
                        because it uses inline CSS styles rather than seperate files. To get around this problem, Inline Styles have been set to allowed in
                        the CSP policy (See FilterConfig.cs). This is not a good practice and reduces some of the security benefits of using it. Keep an eye on
                        <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26532234/modernizr-causes-content-security-policy-csp-violation-errors">this</a> StackOverflow
                        post and
                        <a href="https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/pull/1263">this</a> issue raised on the Modernizr development site for when Modernizr
                        finally adds support for CSP.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Secure the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/elmah/">Elmah</a> error log page, so that anonymous users cannot access it. Open the web.config
                        file and look in 'appSettings' for the 'elmah.mvc.allowedRoles' or 'elmah.mvc.allowedUsers' setting. You can set this value to restrict the
                        Elmah page to a role or individual user. Most likely you will have an 'Administrator' role and you can add this to the 'elmah.mvc.allowedRoles'
                        setting.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Modify the URL used to access the Elmah error log page. This adds security through obscurity. Open the web.config file and you can set the
                        page URL in 'appSettings'. The setting is called 'elmah.mvc.route'. The Elmah error log page is 'http://[YOUR DOMAIN].com/elmah' by default. You can
                        change the value to anything you want. Also, change the elmah route in RouteConfig.cs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you are using SSL, open the FilterConfig.cs file and uncomment the line 'filters.Add(new RequireHttpsAttribute());' to use SSL accross the whole
                        site. Then open the Global.asax.cs file and uncomment the line 'AntiForgeryConfig.RequireSsl = true;'. This ensures that the
                        Anti-Forgery tokens require SSL to work, which gives a little added security. Also, open the web.config file and change the requireSSL setting in the
                        httpCookies section to true, to enable cookies to be sent using SSL only by default.

                        Upload the static files to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network">CDN</a> for vastly better performance.
                        examples of static content include your images, minified CSS bundle content, minified JavaScript bundle content, etc. examples on
                        how to do this are shown

                    <li>
                        Modify the caching settings to increase or decrease the amount of time a file can be cached and where it can be cached. Open the web.config
                        file and under the system.web and caching elements you can find the caching settings.

                    <li>
                        If running IIS 7.5 or below, disable ETags. Open the web.config file and search for 'setEtag' for further instructions.

                        The sitemap.xml, robots.txt, not found error page and unauthorized error page are generated programatically and then cached for a day.
                        If these files won't change much on your site change the length of time they are cached. Open the web.config file and take a look at the caching section.

                    <li>
                        If you are planning on using ASP.NET Web Forms, open the Global.asax.cs file and remove the two lines of code where we are removing the
                        ASP.NET Web Forms view engine. We do this for added performance but if you are using Web Forms, add it back in.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If your this site is deployed to a server cluster and you use MVC anti-forgery tokens, generate a machine key from IIS. You can then open
                        the web.config file and uncomment the machineKey element. Paste in your key generated from IIS here.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If there are subsequent pages that a user is likely to visit, such as the next link on a gallery page, consider adding prefetch or prerender
                        link tags to the head of the page. See <a href="http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2013/11/07/prebrowsing/">here</a> and

Also consider implementing IE11 <a href="msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/jj883726(v=vs.85).aspx">flip ahead</a>, if you have next and previous buttons.

                        Open SitemapService.cs and edit the GetSitemapNodes method. You can decide where or how your links are generated.

                        Navigate to {your site}/glimpse and also learn how to use Glimpse <a href="http://getglimpse.com/">here</a>.
                        Install Glimpse extensions e.g. Glimpse.EF6 allows you to see the SQL being executed by Entity Framework.
                        Extensions are as easy as installing NuGet packages listed at <a href="http://getglimpse.com/Extensions">here</a>.
                        Glimpse can also be used to performance tune your application. It records the length of time taken to perform
                        various actions.

                        Edit the humans.txt file at the root of the site. This is totally optional, you can delete this file if you want (If you delete it, remove
                        the line in RouteConfig.cs which ignores the humans.txt route). Be careful what you put into this file, you could give away clues about
                        potential attack vectors on your site. Even giving contact details can be an attack vector (Most hackers manipulate people to get access).
